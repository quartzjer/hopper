# Plan

## Task

Based on the research context we've built, think through **$task** completely.

1. **Work through it fully** - Consider all impacts, dependencies, edge cases. Be exhaustive and thorough. Make sure you have the complete picture before summarizing.

2. **Identify all changes needed** - What files, functions, references, docs need updating? How do we make our solution robust and maintainable?

3. **Order by dependencies** - What needs to happen first? Group related changes.

## Output

Present a concise but complete action plan:

- Categorized list of changes (no code snippets)
- Clear sequence if order matters
- Any risks or open questions

Planning only - no implementation yet. Ready for review before proceeding. Thanks!
