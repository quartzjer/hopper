# Commit

Start by running `git status` to see what needs to be committed.

Stage only your changes, ignore any other changes present. If something is already staged that is OK - it was staged elsewhere to be part of this commit.

Then consider what a good short and long git message should contain to helpfully capture just the changes you made.

Do the git commit and then reply with a short confirmation, we don't need to repeat or re-state the previous responses.
