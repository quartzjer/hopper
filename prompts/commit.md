## Task

Congrats, these changes are great, thank you!

First stage only your changes, ignore any other changes present.

If something is already staged that is OK it was staged elsewhere to be part of this commit.

Then consider what a good short and long git message should contain to helpfully capture just the changes you made.

Do the git commit and then reply with a short confirmation, we don't need to repeat or re-state the previous responses.
