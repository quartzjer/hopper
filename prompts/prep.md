# Background Research

## Request

Build complete context for **$request**.

1. **Read the specified references** - Start with any docs, files, or areas mentioned. Understand the design and expectations.

2. **Trace all code paths** - Follow the logic from entry points through all dependencies. Track down every function, utility, and data flow involved. Be exhaustive.

3. **Find all touch points** - Scan the codebase for everything that reads, writes, calls, or depends on the target area.

4. **Understand how it all works together** - What are the key patterns and conventions in use?

## Output

Present a concise summary demonstrating you understand this area:

- How the current implementation works
- All relevant files and functions (with file:line refs)
- Dependencies and consumers
- Key patterns to follow

Research only - no implementation yet. This context will inform the design phase. Thanks!
